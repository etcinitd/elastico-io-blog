  <p>We&rsquo;ve all had those professors/teachers that we just don&rsquo;t seem to mesh with. Recently, I had a professor with whom I could not set aside my differences. The class was about Mobile Application Development. I went into it thinking, &#8220;Wow, I&rsquo;m excited! Finally, I&rsquo;ll be able to create an iOS/Android application!&#8221; On the first day of the class, Mr. Barney walked in and said, &#8220;This is not a programming class. This is not an iOS development class.</p>

  <p>Honestly, I&rsquo;m a bit embarrassed to say that I didn&rsquo;t know how to do this before. I&rsquo;ll be creating a blog post here fairly soon on my conversion from WordPress to Jekyll for this blog, but in doing so, I&rsquo;ve learned a lot of cool new things. Due to the vast number of mobile devices in circulation right now, I make it a habit to try and develop for mobile first, and then expand for the desktop user.</p>

  <p>I’m not a programmer. Some people just have that natural itch to want to go out and code all day long, but that isn’t me. I enjoy scripting and web development, but deep, low-level programming just simply isn’t my thing. So the fact that even I was able to create a simple GUI application should tell you how easy it is. The code below might look daunting at first, but we’ll walk through it piece by piece to hopefully clear things up.</p>

  <span class="post-date">Published Dec 6, 2014</span>
  <p>Recently, I’ve really been getting fed up with WordPress. And here’s why. WordPress dates all the way back to 2001. It was originally developed as a simple blogging platform based off of MySQL and PHP. Close to fifteen years later, it’s become a web standard and is used as the Framework/CMS for more than 20% of all the websites on the internet. And that’s exactly the problem. WordPress has exploded into a million different forks and subprojects, and has been expanded to run an equal amount of themes and plugins.</p>

  <p>When I was 16 (yes, I&rsquo;m young, okay?), I had the idea for a Tech Blog. Not that it had never been done before or anything, but it&rsquo;s just that ever since the age of 9, technology is the only hobby or thing in my life that I&rsquo;ve consistently held interest in. I&rsquo;m not sure why I wanted to start one, but I just figured it would be a good way of tracking my progress and learning of various technologies, as well as helping others in anyway, if possible.</p>

  <p>Let me start off right away by saying that you do not “need” an iPad. Regardless of what you do or do not have, you do not NEED an iPad. If you want to hear me go off on a big spiel about instant gratification and entitlement, I could talk your ear off. But we’ll save that for another day. But let’s get to what you’re really interested about. I am not an Apple Fanboy (an Apple Watch for $350?!</p>

  <p>“It’s me, not you. Okay, no. Actually, it is you. We’ve had a good run together. We’ve tried it out for more than a year, but things just aren’t working out. That’s not to say that we haven’t had some good times together, but I’m just ready to move on.” Usually, it’s safer if I keep my credit card in a different room while I’m surfing the internet late at night.</p>

  <p>For anyone who knows me even slightly well knows that I’m a huge fan of WordPress. I use it as my go-to CMS for all of the websites I create, whether for myself or for clients. It gives me the flexibility I need in a well designed format, and it gives my clients the ability to make changes to their own websites without knowing any code. Some people will give you a giant list of plugins that you have to download when first setting up your WordPress site.</p>

  <p>Want to know what my most cherished and valuable piece of photography equipment is? You might be surprised. It’s not my beautiful Canon 6D. Nor is it my 24-70 F2.8 lens. It’s light, portable, and inexpensive, yet it’s the most important piece of equipment that I own: a plastic bag. Last night, we spent the evening playing with steel wool and throwing sparks into circular patterns into the air. Add a little fill flash, and some creativity, and you’ve got a fun evening planned.</p>

  <p>About six months ago, I finally made the switch. Not because I hadn&rsquo;t wanted to do it earlier, or because I suddenly became so fed up with the Windows operating system. I simply just had a little excess of money, and so I figured, &#8220;Well, this will never happen again. Might as well do it now.&#8221; Before I start this article, I simply want to throw out a disclaimer that I am not a hardcore &#8220;fanboy.&#8221; I work as a Computer Technician, and I service both Macintosh and Windows systems.</p>
