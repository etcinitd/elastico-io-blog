So I made a WordPress Theme. And then I kept going and made a theme for Hugo, too.

<img src="/img/screenshot.png" alt="Allegiant - Hugo" />

Why? Because I'm sick of everything else on the internet. And that's not to say that there aren't some great themes out there. There are some truly incredible themes. And they do everything. The problem is, however, that I don't need everything. All I need is a simple page that is aesthetically pleasing, and quick. And that's about it. No frills, no fuss, no crazy configuration options, nothing.

So many of you might be asking then, &#8220;Bryce, why not just use a static site generator for your blog?&#8221; Good question. Been there, done that. And it was fine. I'm definitely a fan of Jekyll. The speed of a static site is great. For the first little while, I missed the features that came with a back-end language (PHP is my backend language of choice, which means WordPress works great for me), and some of the database features too. But of course, those are the benefits of a static site. I quickly was able to cope with some of the losses through the use of third-party commenting systems, like <a href="https://disqus.com/" target="_blank">Disqus</a>, but then I quickly found that I didn't even care about that. You'll notice that on this site, I've completely omitted the comment system.

But the main reason I ditched Jekyll and switched over to Hugo were the painfully slow build times. My blog used to showcase a lot of my photography, and so I probably had around 100 posts total overall, most of which were dedicated posts full of photos. Everytime I made a little, itty-bitty change, it would have to regenerate, and take about 3-5 minutes per generation. That might not sound like a lot, but it would have to regenerate each and every time, regardless of how small of a change I made. And I'm one of those &#8220;code-and-check-and-code-and-check-some-more&#8221; type people. I don't have enough confidence in myself to code lines and lines and lines of code before checking my work.

If you like what you see, you're free to use it. You can <a href="https://github.com/brycematheson/allegiant" target="_blank">head over to my GitHub and grab it off of there</a>.

It's decently fast, getting a 73/100 on Google Page Speed Insights. I've fiddled with it, and I was able to get it up to a 95/100 on my site by using a CDN and playing with some of the render-blocking CSS in the head. It's also responsive, too.

So anyway, enough rambling. Here's a cool theme if you want to use it.
